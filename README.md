libsass-net
===========

**[LibSass has reached its end of life](https://sass-lang.com/blog/libsass-is-end-of-life).**
It will no longer receive updates of any kind. Users should migrate to
[Dart Sass](https://sass-lang.com/dart-sass) at their earliest convenience. There is a
[.NET plugin](https://github.com/Taritsyn/DartSassHost) that wraps Dart Sass available.
